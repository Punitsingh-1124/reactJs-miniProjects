# 🔵 Cell Activation Grid (React + Vite)

This is a small React app built using Vite. It renders a 3x3 grid with a specific pattern, where active cells (green) light up as you click them. Once all active cells are filled, they deactivate in reverse order.

## 📌 Features

* 3x3 grid with pattern
* Only valid (1-marked) cells are clickable
* Green animation on activation
* Deactivation in reverse after all active cells are clicked

---

## 🧠 Logic Notes

* `config` array defines the grid layout
* `order[]` tracks the activation sequence
* Once all active cells are clicked, `deactivateCells()` runs, popping them in reverse
